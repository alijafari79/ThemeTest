ThemeTest
==========

Documentation and Sketches for testing [Arduino](http://arduino.cc) IDE themes. Demonstrates all theme settings. Packaged as a library in order to define all possible keywords.


#### Installation
- Download https://github.com/per1234/ThemeTest/archive/master.zip
- Using Arduino IDE 1.0.x:
  - **Sketch > Import Library... > Add Library... >** select the downloaded file **> Open**
- Using Arduino IDE 1.5+:
  - **Sketch > Include Library > Add ZIP Library... >** select the downloaded file **> Open**


#### Suggested Test Procedure
Pay attention to the contrast between all possible foreground and background colors of text and graphics.
